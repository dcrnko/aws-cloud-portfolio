<title>My Virtualization Skills</title>
</head>
<body>

  <p>Throughought my carrer I have gained skills with virutalization technologies, which I've used to optimize resource utilization, enhance system flexibility, and improve overall infrastructure management. My experience spans various virtualization platforms, covering core concepts from deployment to ongoing maintenance.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>Hypervisors & VM Management:</b> I'm comfortable working with virtualization platforms, managing both **Type 1 (bare-metal)** hypervisors like <i>VMware ESXi</i> and <i>KVM</i>, and **Type 2 (hosted)** solutions such as <i>VirtualBox</i> and <i>Hyper-V</i> on workstations. I regularly create, configure, and manage virtual machines, tailoring their resources to specific workload needs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Virtual Networking:</b> My skills include setting up and configuring virtual networks. I manage virtual switches, implement VLAN tagging for network segmentation, and ensure proper network connectivity between virtual machines and external networks. This involves understanding various networking modes and their applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Storage Management:</b> I have experience with virtual machine storage, including configuring and managing <b>datastores</b>. I understand how to attach and provision virtual disks, and work with shared storage solutions to support advanced features like live migration.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Resource Allocation & Optimization:</b> I allocate and adjust virtual machine resources (CPU, RAM, disk I/O) to ensure optimal performance and efficient use of underlying hardware. This often involves monitoring resource consumption and making adjustments to prevent bottlenecks.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Operational Tasks:</b> I routinely perform essential virtualization tasks such as creating and managing <b>snapshots</b> for system rollback, cloning virtual machines for rapid deployment, and performing <b>live migrations</b> (e.g., vMotion) for seamless workload mobility and maintenance.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>High Availability Concepts:</b> While not always implementing full HA solutions from scratch, I understand the underlying principles of high availability and disaster recovery in virtualized environments, including concepts like failover and replication.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>My aim is to leverage virtualization to build stable, efficient, and adaptable computing environments, contributing to more resilient IT operations.</p>
