      <h2>Terraform (Infrastructure as Code - IaC)</h2>
      <p>
          Skilled in utilizing **Terraform** for robust **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** practices, automating the provisioning and management of cloud resources. Possesses foundational expertise in declaring and deploying infrastructure consistently, repeatedly, and in a version-controlled manner, which boosts operational efficiency and cuts down on manual configuration errors.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Core Competencies:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Language Fundamentals (HCL):</strong> Solid understanding of Terraform's core principles, including **providers, resources, data sources, variables, and outputs**. Competent in writing and interpreting **HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** to define desired infrastructure states.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Resource Management:</strong> Proficient in configuring and authenticating Terraform providers for major cloud platforms. Capable of defining and managing essential cloud resources like **virtual machines, networking components (VPCs, subnets, security groups), and storage (S3 buckets)**.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>State Management:</strong> Practical experience with Terraform **state files (`.tfstate`)**, understanding their role in tracking managed infrastructure. Familiar with local state management and the importance of **remote state** (e.g., S3 backend) for collaborative environments and **state locking** to prevent conflicts.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Basic Workflow:</strong> Competent in executing the fundamental Terraform workflow:
              <ul>
                  <li><strong><code>terraform init</code></strong>: Initializing directories and downloading plugins.</li>
                  <li><strong><code>terraform plan</code></strong>: Previewing proposed infrastructure changes.</li>
                  <li><strong><code>terraform apply</code></strong>: Deploying or modifying cloud resources.</li>
                  <li><strong><code>terraform destroy</code></strong>: Safely de-provisioning managed infrastructure.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Modularity & Reusability:</strong> Ability to define and use **input variables** for flexible, reusable templates. Proficient in extracting **output values** from deployed resources. Understands how to consume basic Terraform **modules** to promote modularity and best practices.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Capable of interpreting common Terraform error messages and performing initial troubleshooting to resolve configuration or deployment issues.
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          This foundational skill set ensures a strong grasp of Terraform's capabilities for automating cloud infrastructure lifecycle management.
