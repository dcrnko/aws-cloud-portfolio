<title>My Ansible Skills</title>
</head>
<body>

  <p>I have a robust and practical set of Ansible skills, enabling me to automate complex tasks, ensure system consistency, and accelerate deployments. My proficiency covers all fundamental aspects of Ansible, from initial setup to advanced playbook design.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><b>Core Architecture & Inventory:</b> I'm proficient in Ansible's architecture, including the <b>control node</b> and managing various <b>managed nodes</b>. I effectively define and organize <b>inventory</b> files (static or dynamic, <i><code>INI</code></i> or <i><code>YAML</code></i>) to accurately represent diverse infrastructures.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Playbook Crafting:</b> My expertise lies in writing clear, well-structured Ansible <b>playbooks</b> in <b>YAML</b>. These playbooks define precise sequences of tasks to achieve desired system states consistently.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Module Mastery:</b> I regularly utilize a wide array of built-in <b>modules</b>, such as <i><code>yum</code></i>/<i><code>apt</code></i> for package management, <i><code>service</code></i> for daemon control, and <i><code>copy</code></i>/<i><code>template</code></i> for file deployments. I also understand when to employ <i><code>shell</code></i>/<i><code>command</code></i> for custom execution.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Dynamic Automation:</b> I make playbooks flexible and reusable through extensive use of <b>variables</b>. I leverage <b>facts</b> (system information) to enable intelligent, conditional task execution. My designs incorporate <b>handlers</b> to trigger actions only when changes occur, optimizing efficiency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Project Organization:</b> I build scalable and maintainable automation using <b>roles</b>. This involves encapsulating tasks, handlers, templates, and variables into modular units for better organization and collaboration. I also apply <b>loops</b> and <b>conditionals</b> (e.g., <i><code>when</code></i> statements) to build robust and intelligent automation flows.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Security & Best Practices:</b> I prioritize security by using <b>Ansible Vault</b> for sensitive data, ensuring credentials remain encrypted. I'm also familiar with <b>Ansible Galaxy</b> for leveraging community roles and maintain an awareness of best practices for writing clean, efficient, and secure automation code.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>My commitment to automation drives me to continually explore Ansible's capabilities, building efficient, scalable, and reliable infrastructure solutions.</p>
