      <h2>Kubernetes Skills</h2>
      <p>
          I successfully passed the **Kubernetes Certified Administrator (CKA)** certification, which helped me gain a comprehensive understanding and practical proficiency in managing Kubernetes environments.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Key Skills Developed:</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <strong>Confident Cluster Setup:</strong> I can install and configure Kubernetes clusters from scratch, including using tools like **kubeadm** and understanding the critical roles of **control plane** and **worker nodes**.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Core Resource Management:</strong> I’m comfortable creating and managing essential Kubernetes resources such as **pods, deployments, services, and namespaces** using **<code>kubectl</code>** and declarative **YAML** configurations.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Troubleshooting Expertise:</strong> I’ve developed strong troubleshooting skills, adept at debugging **pod failures, resolving networking issues, and checking logs and events** to diagnose cluster health.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Networking Know-How:</strong> I understand how **services, DNS, and network policies** function within a Kubernetes cluster and can effectively troubleshoot connectivity problems between components.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> I can manage **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), service accounts, and network security policies** to secure workloads and control access appropriately within the cluster.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Storage & Volumes:</strong> I’m confident in working with **persistent volumes and claims**, understanding **dynamic provisioning**, and managing **storage classes** for stateful applications.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Scheduling & Affinity:</strong> I’ve learned how to influence **pod scheduling** using **taints, tolerations, node selectors, and affinity rules** for optimal resource utilization and workload distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Backup & Recovery:</strong> I know how to back up and restore important cluster data, including **etcd snapshots** and key resource manifests, ensuring data resilience.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Logging & Monitoring:</strong> I can integrate **logging and monitoring solutions** with Kubernetes to observe system behavior, track performance, and proactively troubleshoot issues.
          </li>
          <li>
              <strong>Automation & Efficiency:</strong> I’ve developed a fast, efficient workflow for working with Kubernetes under pressure using **aliases, command-line shortcuts, and YAML templates**.
