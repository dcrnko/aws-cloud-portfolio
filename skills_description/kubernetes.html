        <p>I successfully passed the Kubernetes Certified Administrator certification which helped to gain the following skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Confident Cluster Setup:</strong> I can install and configure Kubernetes clusters from scratch, including using tools like kubeadm and understanding the role of control plane and worker nodes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Core Resource Management:</strong> I’m comfortable creating and managing pods, deployments, services, and namespaces using `kubectl` and declarative YAML.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Troubleshooting Expertise:</strong> I’ve developed strong troubleshooting skills — whether it's debugging pod failures, resolving networking issues, or checking logs and events.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Networking Know-How:</strong> I understand how services, DNS, and network policies work within a Kubernetes cluster and can troubleshoot connectivity problems between components.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> I can manage RBAC, service accounts, and network security policies to secure workloads and control access appropriately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storage & Volumes:</strong> I’m confident in working with persistent volumes and claims, dynamic provisioning, and understanding storage classes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scheduling & Affinity:</strong> I’ve learned how to influence pod scheduling using taints, tolerations, node selectors, and affinity rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backup & Recovery:</strong> I know how to back up and restore important cluster data, including etcd snapshots and key resource manifests.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Logging & Monitoring:</strong> I can integrate logging and monitoring solutions with Kubernetes to observe and troubleshoot system behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automation & Efficiency:</strong> I’ve developed a fast, efficient workflow for working with Kubernetes under pressure using aliases, command-line shortcuts, and YAML templates.
            </li>
          </ul>
